# Prologue #
This is my submission for the C# guild New Year Competition.

I first joined the guild in January 1st of 2019 without knowing the language and thought 
this would be a great way to show off my knowledge of C#, XAML, and JSON and what I have learned so far.
Thank you for taking your time to open this repo.

Enjoy.
